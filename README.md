# Wanted!
Inspired by the nostalgic puzzle minigame from New Super Mario Bros: [Wanted!](https://mario.fandom.com/wiki/Wanted!)

# Gameplay
The goal of this simple game is to find and select the correct shape—square, triangle, circle, or diamond—hidden among the other shapes. At the start of each round, the target shape is displayed, and the player must quickly locate and select it before time runs out. As the levels progress, the difficulty and distraction tactics increase.

The game begins with a 5-second time limit. Players earn 3 seconds for selecting the correct shape but lose 5 seconds for an incorrect choice. The game ends when time runs out or when they surpass level 50.
